**Verification Email:** 23f2003677@ds.study.iitm.ac.in  

**Dataset (2024 Quarterly Retention Rates):**
- Q1: 69.27
- Q2: 67.79
- Q3: 73.97
- Q4: 72.77

**Industry Target:** 85

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- The companyâ€™s **average retention (70.95)** is significantly below the **industry target (85)**.  
- Performance dipped in Q2 (lowest at 67.79), partial recovery in Q3 (73.97), but Q4 ended still under target.  
- The gap vs. industry target remains ~14 points on average.

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Implications
- Declining retention directly threatens **long-term revenue stability**, since acquiring new customers is costlier than retaining existing ones.  
- Sustained underperformance may reduce market share and weaken brand loyalty.  
- Without intervention, resource allocation for FY2025 will be inefficient and growth limited.

## âœ… Recommendations
To bridge the gap to the industry benchmark:  
1. **Implement targeted retention campaigns** (core solution).  
   - Personalized offers for high-churn risk cohorts.  
   - Loyalty/reward programs to increase repeat purchases.  
2. Enhance **customer experience monitoring** (NPS, CSAT) to identify friction points.  
3. Invest in **AI-driven churn prediction models** to act proactively.  
4. Re-engagement campaigns for Q2/Q4 cohorts where drops were most severe.
